Implementation of  DHCP network architecture as part of my SBI topology, featuring two routers (R1 & R2) configured for redundancy and three PCs receiving dynamic IP assignments.

 üîπ R1 ‚Äì Configured as the primary DHCP server
 üîπ R2 ‚Äì Configured as the redundant (secondary) DHCP server
 üîπ PC1&  PC2‚Äì Automatically received IP addresses via DHCP
‚Ä¢ DHCP Pool: SBI NETWORK
‚Ä¢ Network Address assigned
‚Ä¢ Default Gateway: Used to route packets destined for external networks. When a device (like a PC) receives an IP address from DHCP, the default gateway tells it where to send traffic outside the local subnet.
‚Ä¢ DNS Servers: Primary and Secondary address are taken

What is DHCP?
DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.
It is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices (like PCs, laptops, phones) so they can communicate on a network.
Without DHCP, you would have to manually assign IP addresses to every device ‚Äî which is error-prone and inefficient, especially in large networks.
‚úÖ Key Points:
DHCP automates IP address assignment.
It also provides other details like:
Subnet mask 
Default gateway 
DNS server addresses 
Makes network management easier and scalable.

‚öôÔ∏è How DHCP Works (Step by Step)
When a device (like a PC) connects to the network and needs an IP address, DHCP works using a four-step process called DORA:
1Ô∏è. DHCP Discover
The client (PC) sends a broadcast message to find a DHCP server.
This message is called DHCP DISCOVER.
2Ô∏è. DHCP Offer
The DHCP server receives the discover message and responds with a DHCP OFFER.
This offer contains:
IP address the client can use
Subnet mask
Gateway
Lease time (how long the IP is valid)
3Ô∏è. DHCP Request
The client receives one or more offers and chooses one.
It then sends a DHCP REQUEST to the chosen server, saying:
 ‚ÄúYes, I want this IP address.‚Äù
4Ô∏è. DHCP Acknowledgment
The DHCP server sends a DHCP ACK (acknowledgment) confirming the lease.
Now the client can use the IP address and communicate on the network.

Configuration on Router R1
#Configure terminal
#hostname DHCP
#ip dhcp-pool SBI
#network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
#default-router 192.168.1.100
#dns-server 192.168.1.101 192.168.1.102
#End
To check the configuration
#sh running-config | s dhcp
#sh ip dhcp binding
To auto assign Ip configuration on Pc
#ip dhcp
